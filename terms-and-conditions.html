This fee is $15 for every 15 minute period that passes since class has ended. For example, if class ends at 2:55pm, and a parent arrives to pick up their child(ren) at 3:10pm (15 minutes late), the card on file will be charged a $15 fee. (And if there is no card on file, an invoice for $15 will be sent.) If class ends at 2:55pm, and a parent arrives to pick up their child(ren) at 3:25 (30 minutes late), the parent will be charged $30, etc.</p><p>For parents who are consistently 5–14 minutes late for pick-up after more than 1 warning, MetaCoders may begin charging pro-rated late pick-up fees (i.e. $10 for 10 minutes, $14 for 14 minutes.)</p><p>If a parent would prefer for their child(ren) to be self-dismissed or dismissed to an extended daycare program on campus, please inform our staff at contact@metacoders.org at the time of registration. Without additional direction from parents regarding their child(ren)’s dismissal, we always make student safety a priority, and we will wait with your child until your child is picked up or until we have verbal or written confirmation from the parent to release their child.</p></div><div class="container"><h3>Students Arriving to After-School Programs Policy</h3><p>MetaCoders instructors will always pick-up Kindergarteners directly from their classroom. If your child is a Kindergartener, please indicate their classroom at registration so we know where to pick up your child. However, it is our expectation that students who are in 1st grade or higher grades will arrive to our class without assistance. But we understand that sometimes students forget to go to after-school programs! Therefore, for the first 3 weeks of class, for any students who are not present in the classroom within the first 15 minutes of class, we will call parents to ask if this is a planned absence or if maybe their child forgot to go to class. After the first 3 weeks, students should be able to arrive to class on their own without reminders.</p><p>To assist our instructors, please let us know at the time of registration if your child normally attends any extended daycare programs after school. This can be helpful for the first 3 weeks when locating students who forget to come to coding class.</p></div><div class="container"><h3>Student Pick-up After Class Policy</h3><p>Because we want student pick-up after class to be as seamless as possible, we generally do not check parent IDs at student pick-up. However, MetaCoders instructors always ensure that students go home with an adult they know - whether that may be a mom, dad, grandparent, or a friend’s parent who is managing the carpool that day. For this reason, there’s no need to inform us in advance about carpools.</p><p>However, if you have any concerns with your child’s ability to recognize the adult picking them up OR if there are certain adults who are not allowed to pick up your child, please email us at contact@metacoders.org with a list of adults who are allowed or not allowed to pick-up your child. For students who have adults listed as “allowed” or “not allowed”, we will check IDs of adults at pick-up and if a disallowed adult or an adult not listed as allowed tries to pick up your child, we will keep your student with us and try to reach you by phone for confirmation. (Note: in this unlikely situation, if we are unable to reach you by phone, you may incur late pick-up fees - see the late pick-up policy for more information.)</p></div><div class="container"><h3>Auto Opt-in to Phonecalls &amp; Non-Automated Texts</h3><p>By providing us with your phone number at registration, you give MetaCoders permission to call and/or text you regarding the program your child is currently enrolled in, as well as reminders about upcoming programs. Parents should expect to receive no more than 2 texts per month about upcoming programs and can expect closer to 0–1 texts per month on average. Parents can opt-out of texts at any time by emailing us at contact@metacoders.org.</p></div><div class="container"><h3>MetaCoders Media Policy</h3><p>When you register for the class, there is an option to provide MetaCoders with photo/video release that allows us to take pictures and video of your child for promotional purposes. It is always your choice whether you provide us with a photo/video release for your child. On rare occasions, news networks will come film our after-school programs and camps, and only children who have photo/video releases will be recorded for the news.</p><p>For quality assurance, MetaCoders sometimes records our classes to monitor our instructors. Video recorded for the purpose of quality assurance are not saved or ever used for promotional purposes.</p><p>By registering for MetaCoders classes, you agree that all projects and work created by students while at MetaCoders may be used by MetaCoders in promotional materials, online, and other print media and may be shared and used by corporate partners, the media, or other organizations who work with MetaCoders. You also agree that MetaCoders, its owners, agents, partners, facility providers, and employees cannot be held liable for damages and injuries associated with said publishing, including any and all claims based on negligence. Students names will never be published, without the express permission of parents.</p></div><div class="container"><h3>MetaCoders Privacy Policy</h3><p>MetaCoders respects your privacy and will not misuse any data you provide us about yourself and/or your children. Specifically, we guarantee:</p><ul><li>We won’t sell your information to anyone!</li><li>We require your email address so that we can contact you about your child’s experience in class, including sending regular parent reports and future opportunities you may be interested in. If you would like to be removed from an email list at any time, just let us know.</li></ul></div><div class="container"><h3>Miscellaneous Policies</h3><p>Parents must enroll their children in the appropriate grade level class. MetaCoders can, at its sole discretion, decide whether a student belongs in a higher grade level or lower grade level class. MetaCoders curriculum developers specifically design curriculum to be appropriate for specific grade level ranges, so to ensure the most optimal experience for all students in our classes, we will always put students in an appropriate grade level class to start before re-evaluating. If a parent enrolls their child in a class which does not match their child’s grade level (e.g. if a parent enrolls their 2nd grader in a 3rd–5th grade class), MetaCoders will inform the parent of the mistake and offer options to remedy, including transferring to a class in the appropriate grade level range or a refund.</p><p>If your child requires a full-time aide during the school day, MetaCoders reserves the right to require an aide in our after-school programs. In some situations, MetaCoders may be able to find an additional instructor for the class to act as this aide. The cost of an additional instructor is $16/hour (or $16/meeting for a 1-hr class). If you believe your child will require an aide during our class, please contact us before the first class is scheduled to begin.</p><p>Also, any child that is so disruptive in the classroom as to require extraordinary attention from the MetaCoders instructor(s) may be removed from the class. The class fees will be refunded minus the cost of the classes that have already passed.</p></div></div><style>
