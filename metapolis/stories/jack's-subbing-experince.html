Ruby is out-sick and won't be able to teach today's class. HQ informed Jack that none of the other coaches is available for this shift and it would be awesome if he could sub-in today.<br /><br />Luckily, Jack had reviewed some sub training materials some weeks ago. He informs HQ that he doesn't want the students to miss a class and he's happy to sub-in. He clocks in to review the training materials and reads over some notes that Ruby sent to HQ about her plan for today's class. Jack proceeds to pack-up for the class and heads over to the class location.<br /><br />Once he arrives, he informs the staff that he's there as a sub and would like to know where the room is. He gets the necessary information and heads over to the classroom to set up the computers. As he's reviewing some last-minute notes some students start to walk into the classroom and look at him bewildered while asking &quot;where's coach Ruby?&quot;.<br /><br />Jack informs them that Ruby won't be able to come in today and reassures them that they will see her next time. He then introduces himself, takes attendance and follows the teaching tactics that he went over in the training. Before he even realizes an hour goes by and he instructs the students to start the wrap-up procedure. Once the students are dismissed, he drives back home. He gets there and unpacks the equipment. After the last computer is charged up he clocks out.</div></div><script src="/metacoders-dot-org/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script>
