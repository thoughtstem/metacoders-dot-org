He has a few minutes before the Kinder students are released,<br /> according to the email. Bruce takes out a couple computers and gets them set up with the<br /> Ratchet GUI while he waits!<br /><br /><h3>1:45pm -- 15 minutes until class start time.</h3><br />Just as promised, the K5 Kindergarten teacher starts lining up his students for dismissal.<br /> Bruce introduces himself as a coach for an after school program, here to pick up Efan Farrell<br /> and Aurelia Todd. The teacher calls both students up; he also tells Bruce that all the<br /> Kindergarten teachers bring their students to the South Gate for dismissal and it might be<br /> easier/preferable to pick up the students there in the future. Bruce thanks the teacher for<br /> the tip.<br /><br />Bruce introduces himself to Efan and Aurelia (he has a feeling he will be saying variations of<br /> &quot;I'm Bruce, a coach from Meta Coders&quot; a lot!) and keeps the conversation going with the two<br /> students as he walks with them to room K1. Bruce remembers from training that class starts the<br /> moment he has 1 student -- so even though he is on the move, he keep the students engaged. The<br /> K1 teacher is already on their way to the South Gate, so Bruce walks with her as he introduces<br /> himself again and asks for Benjamin Gallagher. The teacher informs Bruce that Ben was absent<br /> from school today. Bruce takes Efan and Aurelia back to room 19.<br /><br /><h3>1:55pm -- 5 minutes until class start time.</h3><br />Bruce, Efan and Aurelia arrive back at room 19 just as the school bell rings. The classroom is<br /> empty except for 1 student -- who turn out to be 1 of Bruce's remaining 3 students, Colin<br /> Pearson. Bruce knows he needs a few more minutes to set up the last few computers and check<br /> out the room, so he instructs the students to sit at one of the tables and have a quick snack<br /> if they need.<br /><br />Bruce sends a quick slack update on attendance, noting that Ben's teacher told him that Ben was<br /> absent at school today. He also checks his class roster for the name of the 2 students he is<br /> waiting on -- Yu Huang and Ava Cortez. He asks the other students if they know Yu or Ava, and<br /> if they saw her in school today; Colin answers that Ava is in his class and she was in school<br /> today. Bruce updates slack with this info.<br /><br />Bruce pokes his head out the door to see if there are any students that might be Ava or Yu<br /> nearby. He catches Yu as he is walking up to the class. He gets him settled with the rest of<br /> the class, and updates slack that Yu is here!<br /><br />Bruce continues setting up the last of the computers. He also decides where in the room would<br /> be best to put his students and does some minor adjusting to fit all 5 students at one table<br /> by the white board. He keeps an eye on the students while he does all this, reminding Efan to<br /> please go back to the table when he starts wandering around the room, and asking some questions<br /> about their school day when their conversation goes quiet.<br /><br /><h3>2:00pm -- class start time</h3><br />Bruce is finishing up on the last computer, and asks the students to finish up their snack and<br /> put their belongings away by the door. Still no sign of Ava, so Bruce messages the slack again<br /> with that info. Nina responds, saying she will call the parent in five minutes, but points out<br /> the note that Ava does go the school's general after school program, provided by the Y, so she<br /> may be there. Bruce makes sure the volume on his phone is up so he will hear any incoming<br /> messages, then gets ready to continue with class!</div></div><script src="/metacoders-dot-org/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script>
