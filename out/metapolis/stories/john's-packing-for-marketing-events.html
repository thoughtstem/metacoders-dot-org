He finally reached Marina the After School Coordinator at the school and after a couple of emails, John was invited to their parent night event. At this event, multiple vendors are invited to demonstrate what their program is about, talk to parents, and pass out flyers with more information.<br /><br />John is excited about this day because it will give him a chance to share his experience with a lot of parents and tell them what MetaCoders is all about. He clocks in and starts to pack the necessary equipment for the event -- including flyers that he picked up last week from the print shop.<br /><br />Once he arrives at Dijkstra Elementary, John meets up with Marina and she tells him where to setup. He sets up a couple of computers with some demos running, puts out some flyers, and he excitingly waits to the parents to arrive.<br /><br />Parents start to trickle in and John starts to show them some demos, he answers several questions, passes out some flyers and even gets a couple of them to sign up for the class on the spot. After an hours or so, almost all the parents are gone so John packs up and leaves.<br /><br />He gets home, chargers up the equipment, and clocks out.<br /><br />After the weekend passes John received an email from MetaCoders saying that there are 8 students enrolled at Dijsktra and the class will start on the following week!</div></div><script src="/metacoders-dot-org//js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="/metacoders-dot-org//js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
