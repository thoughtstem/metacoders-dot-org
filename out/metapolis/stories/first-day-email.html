He will be coaching an after school program for K-2nd graders at Lovelace Elementary School. Bruce is excited, but also nervous!<br /><br />Bruce receives an email from Meta Coders with the subject &quot;Your Lovelace Elementary Class!&quot;. Upon opening it, he sees there is a lot of information and, at first, it only increases his nerves. But as Bruce reads the email, he sees answers to a lot of the questions he had -- and several questions he didn't think to have! It tells him:<br /><br /><ul><li>Where he should pick up equipment and when</li><li>Where he should park</li><li>What classroom he is in</li><li>How many students are in the class</li><li>Where he should go when he arrives</li><li>How students will get to and leave class</li><li>...it even includes a map of the school with important locations marked on it and the class roster with all student information!</li></ul><br /><br />Armed with new information on what to expect at Lovelace Elementary, Bruce feels calmer and ready for his first class day!<br /><br /></div></div><script src="/metacoders-dot-org//js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js"></script><script src="/metacoders-dot-org//js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
